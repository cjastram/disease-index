                Natural History: |
                    Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is a chronic multisystem disease of autoimmune origin. 
                    The damage to body tissues is mediated through numerous autoantibodies and immune complexes. 

                    Prevalence of 15-50 / 100,000 in US.  Incidence of 1.8-7.6 / 100,000 per year.
                    Females more than males 9-1.  1 in 700 women of childbearing age, 1 in 245 for
                    African-American women.

                    Caused by a failure of self-tolerance.  Principally affects skin, kidneys, joints,
                    and serosal membranes, but many others as well.  Many antibodies, including
                    antinuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, ati-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-Ro (SS-A), anti-La (SS-B),
                    antihistones, antiphospholipids, antierythrocyte, antiplatelet, antineuronal, and 
                    antiribosomal P.  Numerous HLA DR/DQ genetic susceptibility traits.  Triggers
                    include infectious agents causing hyperactivity in the immune system as well as
                    numerous drugs including hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, and D-penicillamine.
                    SLE patients tend to have elevated titers to Epstein-Barr.
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Acute or insidious, chronic, remitting and relapsing.  Often presents as a butterfly
                    rash in a young woman accompanied by fever, joint pain, pleuritic pain, and
                    photosensitivity, but may also include protean, neurological, renal, and cardiac
                    complaints.
                Tests: |
                    Immunofluorescence testing for ANA antibodies, double stranded DNA antibodies,
                    or Smith antibodies Sm, SS-A, and SS-B.

                    ACR diagnostic criteria includes 4 or more of;
                        Malar rash
                        Discoid rash
                        Photosensitivity
                        Oral ulcers
                        Arthritis (intermittent polyarthritis)
                        Serositis (pleuritis, pericarditis)
                        Renal disorders (proteinuria)
                        Neurologic disorders (seizures or psychosis)
                        Hematologic disorder (hemolytic anemia, leukopenia)
                        Immunologic disorder (Anti-ds DNA, snit-Sm, antiphospholipid)
                        Antinuclear antibody
                Treatment:
                    For non-life-threatening presentations, use of analgesics and antimalarials to 
                    suppress symptoms.  For more serious presentations, systemic glucocorticoids
                    and cytotoxic drugs.
                Management:
                    Rarely may progress to death within weeks.  Typically characterized by flares
                    and remissions.  Death most commonly caused by renal failure and intercurrent
                    infections.  Pregnancy risks include increased fetal loss, and glucocorticoid
                    use is recommended to suppress disease activity during pregnancy.
                Prevention:
                    Appropriate vaccines?  Control osteoporosis (glucocorticoids), control 
                    hypertension and atherosclerosis.
            - Erythema nodosum (1-3):
                Natural History: >
                    Incidence is 0.02-0.03 / 1000 patients / year.  Associated with infections such as
                    beta-hemolytic strep and TB, also with drugs such as sulfonamides and oral
                    contraceptives, also with sarcoidosis and IBS.  Panniculitis is an inflammatory 
                    reaction in the subcutaneous fat and fascia. Erythema nodosum (EN), the most 
                    common form of panniculitis, is an acute onset of a tender nodular, erythematous 
                    eruption that usually is limited to the extensor aspects of the lower legs. 
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Poorly defined, tender erythematous plaques and nodules, typically in the LE.
                    Lesions are erythematous and edematous with neutrophilic infiltration.
                Tests: Biopsy
            - Systemic Sclerosis (1-3):
                Natural History: |
                    Rare.  Systemic sclerosis is a rare, multisystem, chronic disorder of unknown cause 
                    (most likely autoimmune in nature) , characterized by excessive tissue fibrosis, 
                    small blood vessel vasculopathy and autoimmunity. Tissue thickening is especially
                    prominent in the dermis resulting in thickening skin.

                    67m and 265f per 100,000 per year (3-1 ratio).  Peak incidence 50-60 years of age.
                    Unknown triggering agent, abnormal CD4+ T-cells and Th2, growth factors, cytokines,
                    T-cell mediated fibrogenesis and vascular injury.  Abnormal humor response, ANAs
                    detectable in most patients.  Skin most commonly affected, but others include GI,
                    renal, heart, skeletal muscle, and lungs.  Microvascular disease occurs early,
                    as inital event involving endothelial cell damage and release of platelet factors
                    stimulating periadventitial fibrosis.  Subsequent vasoconstriction and tissue
                    ischemia.

                    Two classifications; diffuse and limited.  Diffuse characterized by widespread
                    skin involvement and rapid progression to include visceral organs.  Limited is
                    usually confined to fingers, forearms, and face.   CREST; Calcinosis, Raynaud,
                    Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia.

                    Antibodies for platelet-derived growth factor found in all patients with systemic
                    sclerosis.
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Insidious.  Often starts with Raynaud's and puffy fingers, progressing to swollen
                    fingers and hands, then taut, firm, hard, and thickened skin.  Swelling and stiffness
                    in joints and joint pain.  Thickening of tendon sheaths, loss of motion, crepitation.
                    GI involvement, esophagus dysmotility.  Malignant hypertension leading to renal 
                    failure.  Pulmonary fibrosis.  Death.
                Tests: >
                    Elevated ESR.  Rheumatoid factor in 25 percent.  Autoantibodies include ANA (95%),
                    anticentromere (22-36% limited), anti-scl 70 (DNA topoisomerase) (28-70, diffuse),
                    anti-RNA polymerase I, II, III, anti-Th RNP, anti-U1 RNP, anti-U3 RNP, anti-PM/Scl.
                    X-rays show destructive changes in the joints, soft tissue calcification, and
                    resorption of periarticular bone.

                Natural History: >
                    5.5 per million people. Dermatomyositis (DM) is a chronic inflammatory myopathy similar to 
                    polymyositis (PM). DM can be separated from PM in that the later also involves dermatologic 
                    manifestations.
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Heliotrophic rash in upper eyelids and periorbital edema, but rash can occur on back, neck, 
                    or chest and may be photosensitive.  Grotton lesions.  Bilaterally symmetrical muscle weakness,
                    proximal greater than distal but progressing distally and may be accompanied by myalgias.
                    Associated symptoms include lung disease, vasculitis, and myocarditis.
                Tests: >
                    X-rays for soft tissue calcification and swelling about joints.  MRI for inflammatory
                    changes in muscle.  EMG and muscle biopsy.  Lab studies include serum creatine phosphokinase 
                    (CPK), serum aldolase (ALD), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum glutamic oxalacetic 
                    transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), rheumatoid factor and ANA 
                    antibodies are present in half the cases, anti-Jo1 (more specific for polymyositis than
                    dermatomyositis), antipMi-2 antibodies, antisignal recognition protein (anti-SRP),
            - Polymyositis  (1-3):
                Natural History: >
                    0.5 to 8.4 per million.  Autoimmune process, possibly related to viral illness or drug use.
                    Polymyositis, or idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, is a subacute inflammatory disease of 
                    skeletal muscle (myopathy).
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    No rash, unlike DM. Muscular manifestions include symmetrical weakness proximal > distal,
                    weakness of neck flexors, myalgias, dysphagia and dysphonia, rarely facial and bulbar 
                    muscle weakness.  Constitutional manifestations include morning stiffness, fatigue,
                    anorexia, weight loss, fever.  Other manifestations include pulmonary diseases,
                    cardiac arrythmias, joint pain, acute renal tubular necrosis, and mechanic's hands
                    (thickening of the skin).
                Tests: >
                    Serum creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aldolase, CBC showing
                    leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, ESR elevated, ANA positive in one third of patients, anti-Jo-1, 
                    antisignal recognition particles ASRP, MRI scans when appropriate, EMG studies, muscle biopsy.

            - Leiomyoma (1-2):
                Natural History: > 
                    Most common neoplasm for women.  AKA uterine fibroids, these are tumors of smooth muscle.
                    Development of multilesion form is hereditary.  Commonly in uterus.  Forms during adolescence
                    and early adulthood.
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Depends on location.  Nonpainful lump, but pain may result from compression of surrounding tissue.
            - Leiomyosarcoma  (1-2):
                Natural History: >
                    10-20% of soft tissue sarcomas.  These are malignant tumors of smooth muscle, occuring in adults,
                    women > men.  Most develop in retroperitoneal or intraabdominal sites, other common places 
                    include skin and deep soft tissue of extremities (typically associated with veins) however they 
                    can be found anywhere and may become quite large.
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Painless firm masses, mass effect on surrounding tissue may occur when located in the 
                    retroperitoneum.
            - Rhabdomyosarcoma (1-2):
                Natural History: >
                    Most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence.  6 per million (250 cases) in
                    children <15.  Presents before 20yo.  Arise most often in head, neck, and GU tract, as well as
                    skeletal muscle of extremities.  PAK3-FKHR gene fusion dysregulating muscle differentiation.
                    Three types include embryonal (most common), alveolar, and pleomorphic.  These are aggressive
                    tumors that require treatment.
                Clinical Presentation: >
                    Mass expanding lesion, specific signs and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor
